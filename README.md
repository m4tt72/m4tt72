# $ whoami?

I am Yassine, a full-stack software developer based in Casablanca, Morocco.

I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.

I am also an experienced musician/guitar player, I have been playing for 9 years, I share my music related stuff on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/m4tt72).
